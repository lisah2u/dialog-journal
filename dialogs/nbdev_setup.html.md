# Nbdev as a journaling framework

I’d like to set up an instance of nbdev as a journaling framework in
solveit where I can journal about knowledge that I’ve gained through
dialog engineering or via a synthesis of reading, thinking, and coding.
I would like a date-based organization for primary navigational
structure, but also want separate section of dialogues that I
incorporate from solveit within this journal. I’d also like to make use
of tags both in code cells and documentation. For example, I’d like to
be able to tag someone else’s dialog that I’d like to re-visit, tag
ideas, and tag fragments of knowledge that seem useful.

nbdev and quarto are installed in solveit after addressing basic
questions about how my local and remote environments are setup following
investigation in [nbdev_environment](nbdev_environment.html). I’m using
this same instance to set up nvdev and know that I can initialize via
nbdev_new. Is this a good place to start?

##### 🤖Reply🤖<!-- SOLVEIT_SEPARATOR_7f3a9b2c -->

Yes, `nbdev_new` is a good starting point! It will create the basic
structure for an nbdev project. However, before we run it, let’s think
about a few things to customize it for your journaling needs:

1.  **Project name**: What would you like to call your journal project?
    (e.g., “knowledge-journal”, “dialog-journal”, etc.)

2.  **Structure considerations**: The default nbdev setup is designed
    for Python libraries, but we can adapt it. You mentioned wanting:

    - Date-based organization for primary navigation
    - A separate section for dialog entries
    - Tag support throughout

After we initialize with `nbdev_new`, we’ll need to customize the
structure and settings to support these features.

Should we start by running `nbdev_new` with a project name you choose,
and then we can explore how to adapt the structure for your journaling
workflow?

Given nb_dev is interactive, can I install from within this notebook?
Will I be able to respond properly to input?

##### 🤖Reply🤖<!-- SOLVEIT_SEPARATOR_7f3a9b2c -->

Good question! Yes, you can run `nbdev_new` from within a code cell in
solveit, but there’s a catch with the interactive prompts.

`nbdev_new` will ask you questions interactively (like project name,
author, etc.), and while it will technically work in a notebook cell,
responding to the prompts can be tricky in this environment.

You have a couple of options:

1.  **Use command-line flags** to pass all the info at once
    (non-interactive mode)
2.  **Try the interactive mode** and see if it works smoothly in solveit

Would you like to try option 1 (providing all parameters upfront), or
would you prefer to experiment with the interactive mode first to see
how it behaves?

If I try the interactive mode and something goes wrong… can we back out
and go to the first option?

##### 🤖Reply🤖<!-- SOLVEIT_SEPARATOR_7f3a9b2c -->

Absolutely! If the interactive mode doesn’t work well, you can just
interrupt it (or let it fail), and we can switch to using the
command-line flags instead. Nothing will break permanently.

The worst case is that it creates a partially configured project, which
we can either delete or just run `nbdev_new` again with flags to
overwrite it.

So yes, it’s safe to experiment. Would you like to try the interactive
mode first?

I’ve run set up - how shall we proceed?

##### 🤖Reply🤖<!-- SOLVEIT_SEPARATOR_7f3a9b2c -->

Great! Now let’s see what `nbdev_new` created for you. Could you run:

``` python
!ls -la
```

This will show us the directory structure that was set up. Once we see
what’s there, we can discuss how to adapt it for your journaling needs
(date-based organization, dialog sections, and tagging).

What does the output show?

``` python
!ls -la
```

Should be out-of-the-box config here.

##### 🤖Reply🤖<!-- SOLVEIT_SEPARATOR_7f3a9b2c -->

Yes, this is the standard nbdev setup:

- `index.ipynb` - becomes your home page
- `00_core.ipynb` - example module notebook
- `_quarto.yml` - Quarto configuration for the site
- `nbdev.yml` - nbdev settings
- `styles.css` - custom styling

Now, for your journaling setup with date-based organization and dialog
sections, we need to think about structure. A few options:

1.  **Flat structure with naming conventions** (e.g.,
    `2024-11-29_topic.ipynb`, `dialog_2024-11-29.ipynb`)
2.  **Subdirectories** (e.g., `nbs/entries/`, `nbs/dialogs/`)
3.  **Hybrid approach** using both

We’ll also need to configure `_quarto.yml` to organize the navigation
how you want it.

Which approach appeals to you, or would you like to hear more about the
trade-offs of each?

I’d like to use sub-dirs and also a naming convention. Dates for journal
entries, and dialogs with topical file names.

- nbs/entries/ - for date-based journal entries (e.g.,
  2024-11-29.ipynb); one per day
- nbs/dialogs/ - for dialog-based entries with topical names (e.g.,
  nbdev_setup.ipynb)
- visible tags like this \#tag: idea that can be a top-line tag for the
  entry or notebook, and also inline tag for cells.

The idea is that I’d like to be able to create a page that aggregate
content with a particular tag on a page later.

I like \#tag: idea. It’s familiar.

##### 🤖Reply🤖<!-- SOLVEIT_SEPARATOR_7f3a9b2c -->

Perfect! `#tag:idea` is clear and familiar.

Now let’s create the directory structure. Would you like to create the
`entries/` and `dialogs/` subdirectories yourself, or would you like me
to show you the commands to do it?

``` python
!mkdir -p nbs/entries nbs/dialogs
!ls nbs/
```

    00_core.ipynb  dialogs  index.ipynb  styles.css
    _quarto.yml    entries  nbdev.yml

## Set up navigation bar

Great. Now what?

##### 🤖Reply🤖<!-- SOLVEIT_SEPARATOR_7f3a9b2c -->

Excellent! The directories are created. Now we need to configure
`_quarto.yml` to set up the navigation structure so your site will have
separate sections for journal entries and dialogs.

Would you like to look at the current `_quarto.yml` file first to see
what’s there? You can view it with:

``` python
!cat nbs/_quarto.yml
```

``` python
!cat nbs/_quarto.yml
```

    project:
      type: website

    format:
      html:
        theme: cosmo
        css: styles.css
        toc: true
        keep-md: true
      commonmark: default

    website:
      twitter-card: true
      open-graph: true
      repo-actions: [issue]
      navbar:
        background: primary
        search: true
      sidebar:
        style: floating

    metadata-files: [nbdev.yml, sidebar.yml]

Let’s continue

##### 🤖Reply🤖<!-- SOLVEIT_SEPARATOR_7f3a9b2c -->

Good! The current `_quarto.yml` is using `sidebar.yml` for navigation.
We need to create that file to organize your entries and dialogs
sections.

Here’s what the `sidebar.yml` structure could look like:

``` yaml
website:
  sidebar:
    contents:
      - index.ipynb
      - section: "Journal Entries"
        contents:
          - entries/*.ipynb
      - section: "Dialogs"
        contents:
          - dialogs/*.ipynb
```

Would you like to create this file, or would you prefer a different
organization for the sidebar?

Let’s continue

##### 🤖Reply🤖<!-- SOLVEIT_SEPARATOR_7f3a9b2c -->

To create the `sidebar.yml` file, you can use:

``` python
with open('nbs/sidebar.yml', 'w') as f:
    f.write(...)
```

Would you like to write this yourself, or would you like me to provide
the complete code to create it?

give me a hand

##### 🤖Reply🤖<!-- SOLVEIT_SEPARATOR_7f3a9b2c -->

Here you go:

``` python
sidebar_content = """website:
  sidebar:
    contents:
      - index.ipynb
      - section: "Journal Entries"
        contents:
          - entries/*.ipynb
      - section: "Dialogs"
        contents:
          - dialogs/*.ipynb
"""

with open('nbs/sidebar.yml', 'w') as f:
    f.write(sidebar_content)
```

This will create the sidebar structure with your two main sections. Try
running it and let me know when you’re ready for the next step!

``` python
sidebar_content = """website:
  sidebar:
    contents:
      - index.ipynb
      - section: "Journal Entries"
        contents:
          - entries/*.ipynb
      - section: "Dialogs"
        contents:
          - dialogs/*.ipynb
"""

with open('nbs/sidebar.yml', 'w') as f:
    f.write(sidebar_content)
```

What else?

##### 🤖Reply🤖<!-- SOLVEIT_SEPARATOR_7f3a9b2c -->

Now you could create your first journal entry or dialog notebook to test
the structure. For a journal entry, you’d create something like
`nbs/entries/2024-11-29.ipynb`, and for a dialog, maybe
`nbs/dialogs/nbdev_journaling.ipynb`.

You could also add tags to your notebooks. In nbdev/Quarto, you can add
metadata to the notebook or use special comment syntax in cells.

Which would you like to tackle first: 1. Create a sample notebook (entry
or dialog)? 2. Set up the tagging system? 3. Something else you have in
mind?

## Tagging (partial solution)

Let’s set up the tagging system and then use this notebook as a sample
dialog.

##### 🤖Reply🤖<!-- SOLVEIT_SEPARATOR_7f3a9b2c -->

Great idea! For the tagging system, there are a few approaches we could
take:

1.  **Frontmatter tags** - Add tags in the notebook’s YAML metadata at
    the top
2.  **Cell-level tags** - Use Jupyter’s built-in cell tags feature
3.  **Custom comment syntax** - Like your `#tag: idea` format in
    markdown or code cells
4.  **Combination** - Use multiple approaches for flexibility

The frontmatter approach would look like:

``` yaml
---
title: "Nbdev Setup"
tags: [nbdev, journaling, setup]
---
```

Your `#tag: idea` syntax could work in markdown cells and be parsed
later to aggregate content.

Which approach appeals to you most, or would you like to use a
combination?

Let’s try each of these. How do I enter frontmatter tags in this
notebook?

##### 🤖Reply🤖<!-- SOLVEIT_SEPARATOR_7f3a9b2c -->

In a Jupyter notebook, you add frontmatter by creating a **raw cell** at
the very top of the notebook with YAML content between `---` markers.

Here’s how to do it:

1.  Insert a new cell at the top of this notebook
2.  Change the cell type to “Raw” (you can use the dropdown or press
    `Esc` then `R`)
3.  Add content like:

``` yaml
---
title: "Nbdev Setup Dialog"
tags: [nbdev, journaling, setup, dialog]
date: 2024-11-29
---
```

Try adding that now. Can you create the raw cell with frontmatter?

Solveit notebooks don’t have cell-level tagging. How would I add custom
metadata to cell JSON?

##### 🤖Reply🤖<!-- SOLVEIT_SEPARATOR_7f3a9b2c -->

In solveit notebooks, each cell has a JSON structure. To add custom
metadata, you’d need to edit the notebook file directly as JSON.

Each cell in the `.ipynb` file has a `metadata` field where you can add
custom properties. For example:

``` json
{
  "cell_type": "markdown",
  "metadata": {
    "tags": ["idea", "important"]
  },
  "source": ["# My content"]
}
```

However, since solveit doesn’t have a UI for this, you’d need to
either: 1. Edit the `.ipynb` file as JSON in a text editor 2. Write
Python code to programmatically add metadata to cells

Would you like to explore writing a helper function to add tags to cells
programmatically, or would you prefer to stick with the comment-based
approach (`#tag: idea`) that’s easier to use while working?

For now let’s use the custom syntax (#tag: idea). But help me understand
how I can programmatically add metadata to cells via a helper function.

##### 🤖Reply🤖<!-- SOLVEIT_SEPARATOR_7f3a9b2c -->

Good choice on the custom syntax for now! For programmatic metadata
editing, here’s the concept:

A Jupyter notebook is just a JSON file. You can load it with Python’s
`json` module or use `nbformat`, which is designed for this. The basic
structure is:

``` python
import nbformat

# Load notebook
nb = nbformat.read('path/to/notebook.ipynb', as_version=4)

# Each cell is in nb.cells, and has a .metadata dict
for cell in nb.cells:
    if 'tags' not in cell.metadata:
        cell.metadata['tags'] = []
    cell.metadata['tags'].append('my-tag')

# Save it back
nbformat.write(nb, 'path/to/notebook.ipynb')
```

The `cell.metadata` is just a Python dict, so you can add any keys you
want. The `tags` key is standard Jupyter convention.

Does this make sense? Would you like to try creating a simple helper
function to add tags to a notebook?

Yes. I’d like a function that I can add to the any cell that calls the
helper and passes a tag or list of tags.

##### 🤖Reply🤖<!-- SOLVEIT_SEPARATOR_7f3a9b2c -->

Great idea! Here’s the approach:

You’d create a function like:

``` python
def tag_cell(tags):
    # Get the current notebook and cell
    # Add tags to that cell's metadata
    pass
```

The tricky part is identifying *which cell* is calling the function. In
Jupyter/IPython, you can use `get_ipython()` to access the kernel, but
finding the exact cell that’s executing requires some inspection of the
execution history.

Would you like to: 1. Create a function that tags cells by their
execution order (simpler) 2. Try to identify the calling cell more
precisely (trickier) 3. Use a different approach, like a function that
takes a cell index as a parameter?

Which sounds most useful for your workflow?

How do we get a cell index? Can we do that from within the cell?

##### 🤖Reply🤖<!-- SOLVEIT_SEPARATOR_7f3a9b2c -->

Getting the cell index from within a running cell is challenging because
when Python code executes, it doesn’t inherently know which cell it came
from.

However, there are a few possibilities:

1.  **IPython execution count** - Each cell has an `In[n]` number you
    can access with `get_ipython().execution_count`, but this is
    execution order, not cell position
2.  **Inspect the notebook file** - Read the `.ipynb` file and match
    cell content or execution count to find position
3.  **Manual passing** - You explicitly pass an identifier when calling
    the function

The most reliable approach would be to read the current notebook file
and use execution count or cell content to find the cell’s position.

Would you like to explore option 2 (inspecting the notebook file)? We’d
need to know the current notebook’s filename first.

This seemed overly complex from solveit, yet straightforward in jupyter
lab. Therefore, the best solution is simply to edit locally in jupyter
lab.

## Prep to deploy

Pause for now. Let’s move to previewing this site. This is what I
believe must happen. Please make improvements or aid with helpful
comments.

- nbdev_clean
- nbdev_export
- nbdev_docs (updates the readme) – not sure if necessary
- git add -A
- Git commit
- Git push - we’ll need to set up a remote with GitHub
- Turn on gh-pages to gh-pages branch on root
- GitHub actions will automatically do things like run nbdev_tests and
  quarto ghp

##### 🤖Reply🤖<!-- SOLVEIT_SEPARATOR_7f3a9b2c -->

Good plan! A few clarifications and additions:

**Your sequence is mostly right:**

1.  `nbdev_export` - Exports code from notebooks to Python modules
    (needed if you have code to export)
2.  `nbdev_docs` - Builds the Quarto site locally in `_docs/`
3.  `git add -A` and commit
4.  `git push` - Yes, you’ll need to set up the GitHub remote first
5.  GitHub Actions will handle `nbdev_test` and deploy via
    `quarto publish gh-pages`

**Notes:** - `nbdev_clean` removes notebook outputs - useful but
optional here - `nbdev_docs` is mainly for local preview; GitHub Actions
will rebuild the site - You don’t manually configure gh-pages branch -
the GitHub Action (`nbdev_ci.yaml`) handles deployment automatically

**Want to preview locally first?** Run `nbdev_preview` instead - it
builds and serves the site so you can view it at `localhost:3000`.

Would you like to: 1. Preview locally first with `nbdev_preview`? 2. Set
up the GitHub remote and push?

I’ve discovered that my mental model for deployment is not quite right.
I’ve had many failures during the GitHub workflow process.

1.  I needed to “install_hooks.” Do I need to do this on both machines?
    How often?
2.  I needed to run nbdev_prepare so that docs would be generated. I’m
    not sure if nbdev_docs supercedes this, so I hope this worked.
3.  I needed to add a code cell at the top of one of my dialogs for \#|
    skip_test since I don’t wish the notebook to run during CI. It adds
    an import for a library that’s not important to run.
4.  Do I need to do nbdev_export every time?

In sum, what are the steps that are part of the initial setup, and what
should I should take before every commit?

##### 🤖Reply🤖<!-- SOLVEIT_SEPARATOR_7f3a9b2c -->

🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠

Great questions! Let me clarify:

**Initial setup (once per machine):** - `nbdev_install_hooks` - Yes, run
this once on each machine where you clone the repo. It sets up git hooks
that auto-clean notebooks before commits.

**Before each commit:** - `nbdev_prepare` - This is the one command to
remember! It runs `nbdev_export`, `nbdev_test`, and `nbdev_docs`
together. So you don’t need to run them separately.

**Your specific questions:**

1.  **install_hooks** - Once per machine, after cloning the repo.

2.  **nbdev_prepare vs nbdev_docs** - `nbdev_prepare` calls `nbdev_docs`
    internally, plus export and test. Use `nbdev_prepare` as your
    standard pre-commit command.

3.  **\#| skip_test** - Correct approach for notebooks you don’t want
    tested in CI.

4.  **nbdev_export** - Not separately needed if you run `nbdev_prepare`.

**Simple workflow:**

    # After making changes:
    nbdev_prepare
    git add -A
    git commit -m "message"
    git push

Does this help clarify things? Any questions about specific failures you
saw?

This does. But I’m also continuing to get a CI error when I push to git.
I’ve added \#| skip test at the top of the notebook where there is a
failure. The error is that notebooks and library code are not in sync -
there is a missing Python dependency: jupyter_client. My expectation was
that with skip_test, it would not try to run that segment of code. Where
is my understanding wrong, and how should I handle this situation?

##### 🤖Reply🤖<!-- SOLVEIT_SEPARATOR_7f3a9b2c -->

Good catch! Your understanding of `#| skip_test` is slightly off:

**What `#| skip_test` does:** - It tells `nbdev_test` to skip running
the code in that cell - But it does NOT skip `nbdev_export` - the code
still gets exported to your Python library

**The error you’re seeing:** The CI is complaining that the exported
Python code imports `jupyter_client`, but it’s not listed in your
dependencies (in `settings.ini`).

**Two solutions:**

1.  **Add the dependency** - Add `jupyter_client` to the `requirements`
    line in `settings.ini`

2.  **Skip export too** - Use `#| skip_exec` or don’t export that code
    at all (if it’s just for demonstration/dialog purposes)

Which approach fits your situation better? Is this code meant to be part
of your library, or is it just for the notebook/dialog?

The notebook is just a dialog. I don’t need to pass any tests. So, my
new understanding is that \#| skip_test goes in the particular cell, not
at the top of the notebook. How exactly is \#| skip_exec used?

##### 🤖Reply🤖<!-- SOLVEIT_SEPARATOR_7f3a9b2c -->

You’re right that `#| skip_test` goes in specific cells, not at the top!

**For dialog notebooks where you don’t want ANY cells tested or
exported:**

Put this at the **top of the notebook** (in the first cell):

    #| default_exp none

This tells nbdev not to export any code from this notebook to your
library.

**For individual cells:** - `#| skip_test` - exports the code but
doesn’t test it - `#| skip_exec` - doesn’t execute the cell during docs
build (but still exports)

**For your dialog notebooks, I’d recommend:** Just use
`#| default_exp none` at the top. This way the entire notebook is
treated as documentation-only, and you won’t have export/sync issues.

Does that clarify things?

Sadly, \#| default_exp none does not eliminate the error. I’m getting
the following error when running the GitHub workflow:
ModuleNotFoundError in
/home/runner/work/dialog-journal/dialog-journal/nbs/dialogs/nbdev_environment.ipynb

##### 🤖Reply🤖<!-- SOLVEIT_SEPARATOR_7f3a9b2c -->

That’s frustrating! `#| default_exp none` should prevent export, but the
CI is still trying to execute the notebook.

Try adding this to the top of that problematic notebook instead:

    #| skip_exec

This tells nbdev not to execute the notebook at all during CI. The
notebook will still appear in your docs, but won’t run.

Alternatively, if you want to be more aggressive, you could add to the
notebook’s raw cell metadata (or first cell):

    skip_showdoc: true
    skip_exec: true

Does adding `#| skip_exec` at the top help?

No. Same error. For adding to the notebook’s raw cell metadata, what if
there is yaml at the top of the notebook for tags like in this
particular notebook?

##### 🤖Reply🤖<!-- SOLVEIT_SEPARATOR_7f3a9b2c -->

Good question! You can combine them. The YAML frontmatter and nbdev
directives can coexist.

Try adding the nbdev directive right after your YAML block, in a
separate code cell:

Then in the next cell:

    #| skip_exec

But I’m wondering if the issue is different - the error might be
happening during `nbdev_test` rather than docs building.

Can you share what the YAML at the top of your notebook looks like
currently? And does the notebook have `#| default_exp none` already?

This was at the top of the notebook: \#| default_exp none

and there was no yaml yet on that notebook.

Below are nbdev cell and notebook level commands for reference.

## Preview (issue)

``` python
# !curl http://localhost:8000
```

I’m unable to see this site from the browser using the vm url at port
8000. From my understanding, this is the port that fastHTML apps are
served via JupyUvi in solveit. This leads me to believe that this is the
intended (open) port. Thoughts?

##### 🤖Reply🤖<!-- SOLVEIT_SEPARATOR_7f3a9b2c -->

You’re right that port 8000 is what’s exposed in solveit for FastHTML
apps. However, `nbdev_preview` uses Quarto’s preview server, which
typically runs on port 3000 or another port by default.

**Options to fix this:**

1.  **Tell Quarto to use port 8000:**

    ``` python
    !quarto preview nbs --port 8000 --host 0.0.0.0
    ```

2.  **Check what port nbdev_preview is actually using** - look at the
    output when you ran it

Did you run `nbdev_preview` already? If so, what output did it show
about the port/URL?

None of these ports worked. So for now… no preview from my solveit vm.

## Push to GitHub

Note - the challenge with installing nbdev at the top-level of this VM
is that I had to be very careful with the .gitignore because of
sensitive files and dirs. I would create a separate dir in the future.
Here’s my .gitignore.

``` text
# Python-generated files
__pycache__/
*.py[oc]

# Virtual environments
.venv/
.env/

# Jupyter notebooks
.ipynb_checkpoints/

# nbdev build artifacts
_proc/

site/
build/
dist/

# User/editor/system noise

# Shell history (should not be versioned)

Please list the commands to set up certs for logging into GitHub,
creating a repo on that end, setting the remote here on this side, and
pushing.

##### 🤖Reply🤖<!-- SOLVEIT_SEPARATOR_7f3a9b2c -->

Here’s the sequence:

**1. Generate SSH key (if you don’t have one):**

``` bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

**2. Copy the public key:**

``` bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

**3. Add the key to GitHub:** - Go to GitHub Settings → SSH and GPG keys
→ New SSH key - Paste the public key

**4. Create repo on GitHub** (via web interface or gh CLI)

**5. Set remote and push:**

``` bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repo-name.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Do you already have an SSH key set up, or should we start from step 1?

## Host pages in GitHub

Check that gh-pages is selected in the pages setting - and set to /root.

<img src="images/github-gh-pages.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>

## Pull from GitHub and run locally

This was straightforward. On my local machine, I had to make a small
change in solveit_requirements_freeze.txt, so I created a
requirements_mac.txt that eliminated the solveit library and the +cpu
options on torch libs.

Is there advice for working between computers when I can only do an
nbdev_preview on the local machine? I believe that if I move my solveit
nbs to the dialog dir here - and handle custom libs, accordingly, there
shouldn’t be any real issues.

##### 🤖Reply🤖<!-- SOLVEIT_SEPARATOR_7f3a9b2c -->

Good question! Here’s a workflow that should work well for your
situation:

**Development flow:** 1. Work on content in solveit (where you have full
dialog engineering capabilities) 2. Push changes to GitHub from solveit
3. Pull to local machine for preview with `nbdev_preview` 4. Make any
preview-related tweaks locally if needed 5. Push back to GitHub

**Key considerations:** - Keep your notebooks in `nbs/entries/` or
`nbs/dialogs/` regardless of where you create them - Custom libs: If you
use solveit-specific libraries in your notebooks, you have a few
options: - Add conditional imports (check if lib exists before
importing) - Keep those notebooks as documentation-only (no code
execution needed for preview) - Mock the imports in your local
environment

**Does this match what you were thinking?** Or do you have specific
solveit libraries you’re concerned about handling?

## Reflection

This took far longer to accomplish than I expected. The chief challenges
have been: - Understanding the mental model for nbdev directives -
Dealing with raw cells (not rendering as expected) as well as notebook
and cell level nbdev directives. I don’t entirely understand the
intersection between nbdev and quarto on these so should learn more. -
For example, when I included the text from my .github file, quarto
rendered it as markdown. This was despite marking the cell as \#| raw.
Thinking about how you want your cells rendered is important. - Figuring
out how to edit metadata in jupyter lab when testing locally. - Setting
up tag level cells. - This is easy in jupyter lab but not solveit. So
edit these locally.
