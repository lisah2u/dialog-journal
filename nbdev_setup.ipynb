    "I'd like to set up an instance of nbdev as a journaling framework in solveit where I can journal about knowledge that I've gained through dialog engineering or via a synthesis of reading, thinking, and coding. I would like a date-based organization for primary navigational structure, but also want separate section of dialogues that I incorporate from solveit within this journal. I'd also like to make use of tags both in code cells and documentation. For example, I'd like to be able to tag someone else's dialog that I'd like to re-visit, tag ideas, and tag fragments of knowledge that seem useful. "

    "1. **Project name**: What would you like to call your journal project? (e.g., \"knowledge-journal\", \"dialog-journal\", etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Structure considerations**: The default nbdev setup is designed for Python libraries, but we can adapt it. You mentioned wanting:\n",

    "   - Tag support throughout\n",
