I would like a date-based organization for primary navigational structure, but also want separate section of dialogues that I incorporate from solveit within this journal. I’d also like to make use of tags both in code cells and documentation. For example, I’d like to be able to tag someone else’s dialog that I’d like to re-visit, tag ideas, and tag fragments of knowledge that seem useful.\nnbdev and quarto are installed in solveit per investigation in this dialog https://sparkling-sunset-rushes-5idg2w.solve.it.com/dialog_?name=nbdev_environment. I’m using this same instance to set up nvdev and know that I can initialize via nbdev_new. Is this a good place to start?\n\n\nYes, nbdev_new is a good starting point! It will create the basic structure for an nbdev project. However, before we run it, let’s think about a few things to customize it for your journaling needs:\n\nProject name: What would you like to call your journal project? (e.g., “knowledge-journal”, “dialog-journal”, etc.)\nStructure considerations: The default nbdev setup is designed for Python libraries, but we can adapt it. You mentioned wanting:\n\nDate-based organization for primary navigation\nA separate section for dialog entries\nTag support throughout\n\n\nAfter we initialize with nbdev_new, we’ll need to customize the structure and settings to support these features.\nShould we start by running nbdev_new with a project name you choose, and then we can explore how to adapt the structure for your journaling workflow?\nGiven nb_dev is interactive, can I install from within this notebook? Will I be able to respond properly to input?\n\n\n\nGood question! Yes, you can run nbdev_new from within a code cell in solveit, but there’s a catch with the interactive prompts.\nnbdev_new will ask you questions interactively (like project name, author, etc.), and while it will technically work in a notebook cell, responding to the prompts can be tricky in this environment.\nYou have a couple of options:\n\nUse command-line flags to pass all the info at once (non-interactive mode)\nTry the interactive mode and see if it works smoothly in solveit\n\nWould you like to try option 1 (providing all parameters upfront), or would you prefer to experiment with the interactive mode first to see how it behaves?\nIf I try the interactive mode and something goes wrong… can we back out and go to the first option?\n\n\n\nAbsolutely! If the interactive mode doesn’t work well, you can just interrupt it (or let it fail), and we can switch to using the command-line flags instead. Nothing will break permanently.\nThe worst case is that it creates a partially configured project, which we can either delete or just run nbdev_new again with flags to overwrite it.\nSo yes, it’s safe to experiment. Would you like to try the interactive mode first?\nI’ve run set up - how shall we proceed?\n\n\n\nGreat! Now let’s see what nbdev_new created for you. Could you run:\n!ls -la\nThis will show us the directory structure that was set up. Once we see what’s there, we can discuss how to adapt it for your journaling needs (date-based organization, dialog sections, and tagging).\nWhat does the output show?\n\n!ls -la\n\ntotal 192\ndrwxrwsr-x 12 solveit solveit  4096 Nov 29 22:05 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 solveit solveit  4096 Nov 29 14:25 ..\n-rw-------  1 solveit solveit   394 Nov 29 17:34 .bash_history\ndrwxrwsr-x  8 solveit solveit  4096 Nov 29 17:15 .cache\ndrwxrwsr-x  3 solveit solveit  4096 Nov 29 17:03 .config\ndrwxrwsr-x  8 solveit solveit  4096 Nov 29 17:13 .git\ndrwxrwxr-x  3 solveit solveit  4096 Sep  1  2024 .github\n-rw-rw-r--  1 solveit solveit   109 Nov 29 14:50 .gitignore\ndrwxr-sr-x  3 solveit solveit  4096 Nov 29 14:30 .ipython\ndrwxrwsr-x  4 solveit solveit  4096 Nov 29 14:45 .local\n-rw-rw-r--  1 solveit solveit     5 Nov 29 14:50 .python-version\ndrwxrwsr-x  5 solveit solveit  4096 Nov 29 14:51 .venv\n-rw-rw-r--  1 solveit solveit 11337 Sep  1  2024 LICENSE\n-rw-rw-r--  1 solveit solveit   111 Sep  1  2024 MANIFEST.in\n-rw-rw-r--  1 solveit solveit  1361 Nov 29 17:15 README.md\ndrwxrwsr-x  4 solveit solveit  4096 Nov 29 17:15 _proc\ndrwxrwsr-x  2 solveit solveit  4096 Nov 29 17:15 dialog_journal\n-rw-rw-r--  1 solveit solveit    82 Nov 29 14:50 main.py\n-rw-------  1 solveit solveit 35432 Nov 29 17:17 nbdev_environment.ipynb\n-rw-------  1 solveit solveit 10077 Nov 29 22:05 nbdev_setup.ipynb\ndrwxrwsr-x  4 solveit solveit  4096 Nov 29 17:28 nbs\n-rw-rw-r--  1 solveit solveit   176 Nov 29 17:15 pyproject.toml\n-rw-rw-r--  1 solveit solveit  1025 Nov 29 17:15 settings.ini\n-rw-rw-r--  1 solveit solveit  2891 Sep  1  2024 setup.py\n-rw-rw-r--  1 solveit solveit  3969 Nov 29 15:11 solveit_requirements_freeze.txt\n-rw-r--r--  1 root    solveit    26 Nov 29 17:19 solveit_settings.json\n-rw-rw-r--  1 solveit solveit 39273 Nov 29 14:51 uv.lock\n\n\nI had a couple of existing notebooks and some stuff before 17.15 that are not relevant.

A few options:\n\nFlat structure with naming conventions (e.g., 2024-11-29_topic.ipynb, dialog_2024-11-29.ipynb)\nSubdirectories (e.g., nbs/entries/, nbs/dialogs/)\nHybrid approach using both\n\nWe’ll also need to configure _quarto.yml to organize the navigation how you want it.\nWhich approach appeals to you, or would you like to hear more about the trade-offs of each?\nI’d like to use sub-dirs and also a naming convention. Dates for journal entries, and dialogs with topical file names.\n\nnbs/entries/ - for date-based journal entries (e.g., 2024-11-29.ipynb); one per day\nnbs/dialogs/ - for dialog-based entries with topical names (e.g., nbdev_setup.ipynb)\nvisible tags like this #tag: idea that can be a top-line tag for the entry or notebook, and also inline tag for cells.\n\nThe idea is that I’d like to be able to create a page that aggregate content with a particular tag on a page later.\nI like #tag: idea. It’s familiar.\n\n\n\nPerfect! #tag:idea is clear and familiar.\nNow let’s create the directory structure. Would you like to create the entries/ and dialogs/ subdirectories yourself, or would you like me to show you the commands to do it?\n\n!mkdir -p nbs/entries nbs/dialogs\n!ls nbs/\n\n00_core.ipynb  dialogs  index.ipynb  styles.css\n_quarto.yml    entries  nbdev.yml\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat. Now what?\n\n\nExcellent! The directories are created. Now we need to configure _quarto.yml to set up the navigation structure so your site will have separate sections for journal entries and dialogs.\nWould you like to look at the current _quarto.yml file first to see what’s there? You can view it with:\n!cat nbs/_quarto.yml\n\n!cat nbs/_quarto.yml\n\nproject:\n  type: website\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\n    css: styles.css\n    toc: true\n    keep-md: true\n  commonmark: default\n\nwebsite:\n  twitter-card: true\n  open-graph: true\n  repo-actions: [issue]\n  navbar:\n    background: primary\n    search: true\n  sidebar:\n    style: floating\n\nmetadata-files: [nbdev.yml, sidebar.yml]\n\n\nLet’s continue\n\n\n\nGood! The current _quarto.yml is using sidebar.yml for navigation. We need to create that file to organize your entries and dialogs sections.\nHere’s what the sidebar.yml structure could look like:\nwebsite:\n  sidebar:\n    contents:\n      - index.ipynb\n      - section: \"Journal Entries\"\n        contents:\n          - entries/*.ipynb\n      - section: \"Dialogs\"\n        contents:\n          - dialogs/*.ipynb\nWould you like to create this file, or would you prefer a different organization for the sidebar?\nLet’s continue\n\n\n\nTo create the sidebar.yml file, you can use:\nwith open('nbs/sidebar.yml', 'w') as f:\n    f.write(...)\nWould you like to write this yourself, or would you like me to provide the complete code to create it?\ngive me a hand\n\n\n\nHere you go:\nsidebar_content = \"\"\"website:\n  sidebar:\n    contents:\n      - index.ipynb\n      - section: \"Journal Entries\"\n        contents:\n          - entries/*.ipynb\n      - section: \"Dialogs\"\n        contents:\n          - dialogs/*.ipynb\n\"\"\"\n\nwith open('nbs/sidebar.yml', 'w') as f:\n    f.write(sidebar_content)\nThis will create the sidebar structure with your two main sections. Try running it and let me know when you’re ready for the next step!\n\nsidebar_content = \"\"\"website:\n  sidebar:\n    contents:\n      - index.ipynb\n      - section: \"Journal Entries\"\n        contents:\n          - entries/*.ipynb\n      - section: \"Dialogs\"\n        contents:\n          - dialogs/*.ipynb\n\"\"\"\n\nwith open('nbs/sidebar.yml', 'w') as f:\n    f.write(sidebar_content)\n\nWhat else?\n\n\n\nNow you could create your first journal entry or dialog notebook to test the structure. For a journal entry, you’d create something like nbs/entries/2024-11-29.ipynb, and for a dialog, maybe nbs/dialogs/nbdev_journaling.ipynb.\nYou could also add tags to your notebooks. In nbdev/Quarto, you can add metadata to the notebook or use special comment syntax in cells.\nWhich would you like to tackle first: 1. Create a sample notebook (entry or dialog)? 2. Set up the tagging system? 3. Something else you have in mind?\n\n\n\n\nLet’s set up the tagging system and then use this notebook as a sample dialog.\n\n\nGreat idea! For the tagging system, there are a few approaches we could take:\n\nFrontmatter tags - Add tags in the notebook’s YAML metadata at the top\nCell-level tags - Use Jupyter’s built-in cell tags feature\nCustom comment syntax - Like your #tag: idea format in markdown or code cells\nCombination - Use multiple approaches for flexibility\n\nThe frontmatter approach would look like:\n---\ntitle: \"Nbdev Setup\"\ntags: [nbdev, journaling, setup]\n---\nYour #tag: idea syntax could work in markdown cells and be parsed later to aggregate content.\nWhich approach appeals to you most, or would you like to use a combination?\nLet’s try each of these. How do I enter frontmatter tags in this notebook?\n\n\n\nIn a Jupyter notebook, you add frontmatter by creating a raw cell at the very top of the notebook with YAML content between --- markers.\nHere’s how to do it:\n\nInsert a new cell at the top of this notebook\nChange the cell type to “Raw” (you can use the dropdown or press Esc then R)\nAdd content like:\n\n---\ntitle: \"Nbdev Setup Dialog\"\ntags: [nbdev, journaling, setup, dialog]\ndate: 2024-11-29\n---\nTry adding that now. Can you create the raw cell with frontmatter?\nSolveit notebooks don’t have cell-level tagging. How would I add custom metadata to cell JSON?\n\n\n\nIn solveit notebooks, each cell has a JSON structure. To add custom metadata, you’d need to edit the notebook file directly as JSON.\nEach cell in the .ipynb file has a metadata field where you can add custom properties. For example:\n{\n  \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"tags\": [\"idea\", \"important\"]\n  },\n  \"source\": [\"# My content\"]\n}\nHowever, since solveit doesn’t have a UI for this, you’d need to either: 1. Edit the .ipynb file as JSON in a text editor 2. Write Python code to programmatically add metadata to cells\nWould you like to explore writing a helper function to add tags to cells programmatically, or would you prefer to stick with the comment-based approach (#tag: idea) that’s easier to use while working?\nFor now let’s use the custom syntax (#tag: idea). But help me understand how I can programmatically add metadata to cells via a helper function.\n\n\n\nGood choice on the custom syntax for now! For programmatic metadata editing, here’s the concept:\nA Jupyter notebook is just a JSON file. You can load it with Python’s json module or use nbformat, which is designed for this. The basic structure is:\nimport nbformat\n\n# Load notebook\nnb = nbformat.read('path/to/notebook.ipynb', as_version=4)\n\n# Each cell is in nb.cells, and has a .metadata dict\nfor cell in nb.cells:\n    if 'tags' not in cell.metadata:\n        cell.metadata['tags'] = []\n    cell.metadata['tags'].append('my-tag')\n\n# Save it back\nnbformat.write(nb, 'path/to/notebook.ipynb')\nThe cell.metadata is just a Python dict, so you can add any keys you want. The tags key is standard Jupyter convention.\nDoes this make sense? Would you like to try creating a simple helper function to add tags to a notebook?\nYes. I’d like a function that I can add to the any cell that calls the helper and passes a tag or list of tags.\n\n\n\nGreat idea! Here’s the approach:\nYou’d create a function like:\ndef tag_cell(tags):\n    # Get the current notebook and cell\n    # Add tags to that cell's metadata\n    pass\nThe tricky part is identifying which cell is calling the function. In Jupyter/IPython, you can use get_ipython() to access the kernel, but finding the exact cell that’s executing requires some inspection of the execution history.\nWould you like to: 1. Create a function that tags cells by their execution order (simpler) 2. Try to identify the calling cell more precisely (trickier) 3. Use a different approach, like a function that takes a cell index as a parameter?\nWhich sounds most useful for your workflow?\nHow do we get a cell index? Can we do that from within the cell?\n\n\n\nGetting the cell index from within a running cell is challenging because when Python code executes, it doesn’t inherently know which cell it came from.\nHowever, there are a few possibilities:\n\nIPython execution count - Each cell has an In[n] number you can access with get_ipython().execution_count, but this is execution order, not cell position\nInspect the notebook file - Read the .ipynb file and match cell content or execution count to find position\nManual passing - You explicitly pass an identifier when calling the function\n\nThe most reliable approach would be to read the current notebook file and use execution count or cell content to find the cell’s position.\nWould you like to explore option 2 (inspecting the notebook file)? We’d need to know the current notebook’s filename first.\nPause for now. Let’s move to previewing this site. This is what I believe must happen. Please make improvements or aid with helpful comments.\n\nnbdev_clean\nnbdev_export\nnbdev_docs (updates the readme) – not sure if necessary\ngit add -A\nGit commit\nGit push - we’ll need to set up a remote with GitHub\nTurn on gh-pages to gh-pages branch on root\nGitHub actions will automatically do things like run nbdev_tests and quarto ghp\n\n\n\n\nGood plan! A few clarifications and additions:\nYour sequence is mostly right:\n\nnbdev_export - Exports code from notebooks to Python modules (needed if you have code to export)\nnbdev_docs - Builds the Quarto site locally in _docs/\ngit add -A and commit\ngit push - Yes, you’ll need to set up the GitHub remote first\nGitHub Actions will handle nbdev_test and deploy via quarto publish gh-pages\n\nNotes: - nbdev_clean removes notebook outputs - useful but optional here - nbdev_docs is mainly for local preview; GitHub Actions will rebuild the site - You don’t manually configure gh-pages branch - the GitHub Action (nbdev_ci.yaml) handles deployment automatically\nWant to preview locally first? Run nbdev_preview instead - it builds and serves the site so you can view it at localhost:3000.\nWould you like to: 1. Preview locally first with nbdev_preview? 2. Set up the GitHub remote and push?\n\n\n\n\n\n# !curl http://localhost:8000\n\nI’m unable to see this site from the browser using the vm url at port 8000. From my understanding, this is the port that fastHTML apps are served via JupyUvi in solveit. This leads me to believe that this is the intended (open) port. Thoughts?\n\n\nYou’re right that port 8000 is what’s exposed in solveit for FastHTML apps. However, nbdev_preview uses Quarto’s preview server, which typically runs on port 3000 or another port by default.\nOptions to fix this:\n\nTell Quarto to use port 8000:\n!quarto preview nbs --port 8000 --host 0.0.0.0\nCheck what port nbdev_preview is actually using - look at the output when you ran it\n\nDid you run nbdev_preview already? If so, what output did it show about the port/URL?\nSeems like port 8000 is what we use on solveit’s platform. That didn’t work. So for now… no preview from my solveit vm.\n\n\n\n\nNote - the challenge with installing nbdev at the top-level of this VM is that I had to be very careful with the .gitignore because of sensitive files and dirs. I would create a separate dir in the future. Here’s my .gitignore."

    "text": "Great. Now what?\n\n\nExcellent! The directories are created. Now we need to configure _quarto.yml to set up the navigation structure so your site will have separate sections for journal entries and dialogs.\nWould you like to look at the current _quarto.yml file first to see what’s there? You can view it with:\n!cat nbs/_quarto.yml\n\n!cat nbs/_quarto.yml\n\nproject:\n  type: website\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\n    css: styles.css\n    toc: true\n    keep-md: true\n  commonmark: default\n\nwebsite:\n  twitter-card: true\n  open-graph: true\n  repo-actions: [issue]\n  navbar:\n    background: primary\n    search: true\n  sidebar:\n    style: floating\n\nmetadata-files: [nbdev.yml, sidebar.yml]\n\n\nLet’s continue\n\n\n\nGood! The current _quarto.yml is using sidebar.yml for navigation. We need to create that file to organize your entries and dialogs sections.\nHere’s what the sidebar.yml structure could look like:\nwebsite:\n  sidebar:\n    contents:\n      - index.ipynb\n      - section: \"Journal Entries\"\n        contents:\n          - entries/*.ipynb\n      - section: \"Dialogs\"\n        contents:\n          - dialogs/*.ipynb\nWould you like to create this file, or would you prefer a different organization for the sidebar?\nLet’s continue\n\n\n\nTo create the sidebar.yml file, you can use:\nwith open('nbs/sidebar.yml', 'w') as f:\n    f.write(...)\nWould you like to write this yourself, or would you like me to provide the complete code to create it?\ngive me a hand\n\n\n\nHere you go:\nsidebar_content = \"\"\"website:\n  sidebar:\n    contents:\n      - index.ipynb\n      - section: \"Journal Entries\"\n        contents:\n          - entries/*.ipynb\n      - section: \"Dialogs\"\n        contents:\n          - dialogs/*.ipynb\n\"\"\"\n\nwith open('nbs/sidebar.yml', 'w') as f:\n    f.write(sidebar_content)\nThis will create the sidebar structure with your two main sections. Try running it and let me know when you’re ready for the next step!\n\nsidebar_content = \"\"\"website:\n  sidebar:\n    contents:\n      - index.ipynb\n      - section: \"Journal Entries\"\n        contents:\n          - entries/*.ipynb\n      - section: \"Dialogs\"\n        contents:\n          - dialogs/*.ipynb\n\"\"\"\n\nwith open('nbs/sidebar.yml', 'w') as f:\n    f.write(sidebar_content)\n\nWhat else?\n\n\n\nNow you could create your first journal entry or dialog notebook to test the structure. For a journal entry, you’d create something like nbs/entries/2024-11-29.ipynb, and for a dialog, maybe nbs/dialogs/nbdev_journaling.ipynb.\nYou could also add tags to your notebooks. In nbdev/Quarto, you can add metadata to the notebook or use special comment syntax in cells.\nWhich would you like to tackle first: 1. Create a sample notebook (entry or dialog)? 2. Set up the tagging system? 3. Something else you have in mind?"

    "text": "Let’s set up the tagging system and then use this notebook as a sample dialog.\n\n\nGreat idea! For the tagging system, there are a few approaches we could take:\n\nFrontmatter tags - Add tags in the notebook’s YAML metadata at the top\nCell-level tags - Use Jupyter’s built-in cell tags feature\nCustom comment syntax - Like your #tag: idea format in markdown or code cells\nCombination - Use multiple approaches for flexibility\n\nThe frontmatter approach would look like:\n---\ntitle: \"Nbdev Setup\"\ntags: [nbdev, journaling, setup]\n---\nYour #tag: idea syntax could work in markdown cells and be parsed later to aggregate content.\nWhich approach appeals to you most, or would you like to use a combination?\nLet’s try each of these. How do I enter frontmatter tags in this notebook?\n\n\n\nIn a Jupyter notebook, you add frontmatter by creating a raw cell at the very top of the notebook with YAML content between --- markers.\nHere’s how to do it:\n\nInsert a new cell at the top of this notebook\nChange the cell type to “Raw” (you can use the dropdown or press Esc then R)\nAdd content like:\n\n---\ntitle: \"Nbdev Setup Dialog\"\ntags: [nbdev, journaling, setup, dialog]\ndate: 2024-11-29\n---\nTry adding that now. Can you create the raw cell with frontmatter?\nSolveit notebooks don’t have cell-level tagging. How would I add custom metadata to cell JSON?\n\n\n\nIn solveit notebooks, each cell has a JSON structure. To add custom metadata, you’d need to edit the notebook file directly as JSON.\nEach cell in the .ipynb file has a metadata field where you can add custom properties. For example:\n{\n  \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"tags\": [\"idea\", \"important\"]\n  },\n  \"source\": [\"# My content\"]\n}\nHowever, since solveit doesn’t have a UI for this, you’d need to either: 1. Edit the .ipynb file as JSON in a text editor 2. Write Python code to programmatically add metadata to cells\nWould you like to explore writing a helper function to add tags to cells programmatically, or would you prefer to stick with the comment-based approach (#tag: idea) that’s easier to use while working?\nFor now let’s use the custom syntax (#tag: idea). But help me understand how I can programmatically add metadata to cells via a helper function.\n\n\n\nGood choice on the custom syntax for now! For programmatic metadata editing, here’s the concept:\nA Jupyter notebook is just a JSON file. You can load it with Python’s json module or use nbformat, which is designed for this. The basic structure is:\nimport nbformat\n\n# Load notebook\nnb = nbformat.read('path/to/notebook.ipynb', as_version=4)\n\n# Each cell is in nb.cells, and has a .metadata dict\nfor cell in nb.cells:\n    if 'tags' not in cell.metadata:\n        cell.metadata['tags'] = []\n    cell.metadata['tags'].append('my-tag')\n\n# Save it back\nnbformat.write(nb, 'path/to/notebook.ipynb')\nThe cell.metadata is just a Python dict, so you can add any keys you want. The tags key is standard Jupyter convention.\nDoes this make sense? Would you like to try creating a simple helper function to add tags to a notebook?\nYes. I’d like a function that I can add to the any cell that calls the helper and passes a tag or list of tags.\n\n\n\nGreat idea! Here’s the approach:\nYou’d create a function like:\ndef tag_cell(tags):\n    # Get the current notebook and cell\n    # Add tags to that cell's metadata\n    pass\nThe tricky part is identifying which cell is calling the function. In Jupyter/IPython, you can use get_ipython() to access the kernel, but finding the exact cell that’s executing requires some inspection of the execution history.\nWould you like to: 1. Create a function that tags cells by their execution order (simpler) 2. Try to identify the calling cell more precisely (trickier) 3. Use a different approach, like a function that takes a cell index as a parameter?\nWhich sounds most useful for your workflow?\nHow do we get a cell index? Can we do that from within the cell?\n\n\n\nGetting the cell index from within a running cell is challenging because when Python code executes, it doesn’t inherently know which cell it came from.\nHowever, there are a few possibilities:\n\nIPython execution count - Each cell has an In[n] number you can access with get_ipython().execution_count, but this is execution order, not cell position\nInspect the notebook file - Read the .ipynb file and match cell content or execution count to find position\nManual passing - You explicitly pass an identifier when calling the function\n\nThe most reliable approach would be to read the current notebook file and use execution count or cell content to find the cell’s position.\nWould you like to explore option 2 (inspecting the notebook file)? We’d need to know the current notebook’s filename first.\nPause for now. Let’s move to previewing this site. This is what I believe must happen. Please make improvements or aid with helpful comments.\n\nnbdev_clean\nnbdev_export\nnbdev_docs (updates the readme) – not sure if necessary\ngit add -A\nGit commit\nGit push - we’ll need to set up a remote with GitHub\nTurn on gh-pages to gh-pages branch on root\nGitHub actions will automatically do things like run nbdev_tests and quarto ghp\n\n\n\n\nGood plan! A few clarifications and additions:\nYour sequence is mostly right:\n\nnbdev_export - Exports code from notebooks to Python modules (needed if you have code to export)\nnbdev_docs - Builds the Quarto site locally in _docs/\ngit add -A and commit\ngit push - Yes, you’ll need to set up the GitHub remote first\nGitHub Actions will handle nbdev_test and deploy via quarto publish gh-pages\n\nNotes: - nbdev_clean removes notebook outputs - useful but optional here - nbdev_docs is mainly for local preview; GitHub Actions will rebuild the site - You don’t manually configure gh-pages branch - the GitHub Action (nbdev_ci.yaml) handles deployment automatically\nWant to preview locally first? Run nbdev_preview instead - it builds and serves the site so you can view it at localhost:3000.\nWould you like to: 1. Preview locally first with nbdev_preview? 2. Set up the GitHub remote and push?"

Thoughts?\n\n\nYou’re right that port 8000 is what’s exposed in solveit for FastHTML apps. However, nbdev_preview uses Quarto’s preview server, which typically runs on port 3000 or another port by default.\nOptions to fix this:\n\nTell Quarto to use port 8000:\n!quarto preview nbs --port 8000 --host 0.0.0.0\nCheck what port nbdev_preview is actually using - look at the output when you ran it\n\nDid you run nbdev_preview already?

I believe that if I move my solveit nbs to the dialog dir here - and handle custom libs, accordingly, there shouldn’t be any real issues.\n\n🤖Reply🤖\nGood question! Here’s a workflow that should work well for your situation:\nDevelopment flow: 1. Work on content in solveit (where you have full dialog engineering capabilities) 2. Push changes to GitHub from solveit 3. Pull to local machine for preview with nbdev_preview 4. Make any preview-related tweaks locally if needed 5. Push back to GitHub\nKey considerations: - Keep your notebooks in nbs/entries/ or nbs/dialogs/ regardless of where you create them - Custom libs: If you use solveit-specific libraries in your notebooks, you have a few options: - Add conditional imports (check if lib exists before importing) - Keep those notebooks as documentation-only (no code execution needed for preview) - Mock the imports in your local environment\nDoes this match what you were thinking?

They seem to overlap.\n\n\n🤖Reply🤖\nGood observation! They do overlap, but they serve different purposes:\nsys focuses on the Python interpreter itself: - The Python executable path - Command-line arguments - Module paths and imports - Runtime behavior\nplatform focuses on the underlying system: - Operating system details - Hardware architecture - Python implementation (CPython, PyPy, etc.)\nFor your nbdev setup goal, sys is more useful for understanding the Python environment, while platform helps with system compatibility checks.\nYou could often get by with just one, depending on what you need. For matching environments across solveit and your laptop, sys is probably more directly useful.\nDoes that distinction make sense?\n\nsysconfig.get_paths()\n\n{'stdlib': '/usr/local/lib/python3.12',\n

is the diff between purelib and platlib?\n\n\n🤖Reply🤖\nGood question! Both are site-packages locations, but for different types of packages:\npurelib (pure library): Python-only code with no compiled extensions. Works on any platform.\nplatlib (platform library): Contains platform-specific compiled code (like C extensions). Think numpy, pandas—packages with binary components that differ between Windows/Linux/Mac.\nIn your solveit environment, they both point to the same location (/usr/local/lib/python3.12/site-packages), which is common in many Python installations. The distinction matters more when you have separate directories for pure vs platform-specific code.\nDoes this affect your thinking about syncing between solveit and your local environment?"

You’ve done solid detective work capturing the environment specs. A few clarifying questions before we dig in:\n\nPython version parity: Solveit is running Python 3.12.12. What version do you have locally, and are you flexible about matching it exactly?\nQuarto: You noted Quarto 1.8.24 here. Do you have Quarto installed locally already?\nSync direction: When Solveit’s environment updates (new package versions, etc.), do you want to primarily pull those changes to your local env, or do you anticipate needing changes to flow both ways?\n\nAlso, one thing I noticed: you’re creating a local venv from the frozen requirements, which is a good approach. But the Solveit environment itself doesn’t appear to use a venv or conda—it’s a containerized system-level Python. This means you won’t have identical environments, but you can get functionally equivalent ones for nbdev workflows.\nWhat’s your current local setup look like?"

Since you’re pulling one-way from Solveit → local, here’s the key question:\nHow do you want to detect changes?\nA few options:\n\nManual periodic check: Re-run your freeze script occasionally and diff against your saved solveit_requirements_freeze.txt\nSession-start check: Add a small snippet at the top of your journal that prints versions of key packages (nbdev, fastcore, quarto) so you notice drift quickly\nHash-based detection: Generate a hash of the installed packages and compare to a stored value—quick way to know “something changed” without seeing what\n\nWhich approach appeals to you? Or would you like a combination?\nAlso, for the nbdev journal itself: have you already run nbdev_new or set up a repo structure, or are you starting fresh?\nI like the session-start check, if you can help with that. I am starting fresh with nbdev in solveit.\n\n\n🤖Reply🤖\nGreat! Let’s create a simple session-start check. Here’s a small snippet that will show you the versions of key packages:\nimport sys\nimport importlib.metadata as md\n\npackages = ['nbdev', 'fastcore', 'quarto']\nprint(f\"Python: {sys.version.split()[0]}\")\nfor pkg in packages:\n    try:\n        print(f\"{pkg}: {md.version(pkg)}\")\n    except:\n        print(f\"{pkg}: not installed\")\nYou can run this at the start of each session to quickly spot changes. Want to try it?\nFor starting fresh with nbdev: have you thought about what you’d like to name your journal project, or should we just use something simple like “solveit-journal”?\n\nimport sys\nimport importlib.metadata as md\n\npackages = ['nbdev', 'fastcore', 'quarto']\nprint(f\"Python: {sys.version.split()[0]}\")\nfor pkg in packages:\n    try:\n        print(f\"{pkg}: {md.version(pkg)}\")\n    except:\n        print(f\"{pkg}: not installed\")\n\nPython: 3.12.12\nnbdev: 2.4.6\nfastcore: 1.8.16\nquarto: not installed\n\n\nIs there an issue with the use of hyphens in nbdev project names? I believe there used to be.\n\n\n🤖Reply🤖\nGood catch! Yes, there can be issues with hyphens in nbdev project names because:\n\nPython package names: While PyPI allows hyphens, Python imports require underscores (you can’t import my-package, only import my_package)\nnbdev convention: nbdev typically converts hyphens to underscores for the actual package/module name, but this can create confusion between the repo name and import name\n\nThe safest approach is to use underscores throughout (like solveit_journal) or no separators at all (like solveitjournal).\nWhat naming style do you prefer for your journal project?\nI did a lot of tinkering in this notebook. Are there imports I can now delete by looking at the code cells in this notebook and cross-checking with my import statement?\n\n\n🤖Reply🤖\n🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠\nBased on the code cells I can see, here’s what appears to be used vs unused from your main import:\nimport sys, sysconfig, platform, pkgutil, pip, json, pathlib, jupyter_client\nUsed: - sys ✓ - sysconfig ✓ - platform ✓ - pip ✓ - jupyter_client ✓\nAppear unused: - pkgutil - json - pathlib\nHowever, I can only see the cells that have been shared with me in this conversation.

Based on what we’ve discovered:\nNotebook environment: - Uses /usr/local/bin/python (system-level, containerized) - Site-packages at /usr/local/lib/python3.12/site-packages - No venv or conda active\nUser installs (like your uv): - Go to /app/data/.local/lib/python3.12/site-packages - Binaries land in /app/data/.local/bin/\nKey insight: The container has a read-only system Python with pre-installed packages, but your /app/data/ directory is writable and persistent. User-installed packages go there.\nThis means:\n\nTo check what the notebook can import, always use sys.executable and importlib.metadata from within the notebook—not terminal commands\nUser-installed packages may need explicit PATH additions for binaries (like you did with /app/data/.local/bin/uv)\nThe system packages are managed by the Solveit platform; you can add packages but probably can’t upgrade the core ones\n\nDoes this match your mental model? And does it raise any concerns for your nbdev workflow?\nWhere should I put libraries that I write, that I might want to reference from a solveit notebook?\n\n\n🤖Reply🤖\nGreat question! You have a few options depending on how you want to use your libraries:\nOption 1: Install as editable package Put your library code in /app/data/ (or subdirectory), add a setup.py or pyproject.toml, then pip install -e . from that directory. This makes it importable from any notebook.\nOption 2: Add to sys.path Put your library in /app/data/mylibs/ and add this to your notebook:\nimport sys\nsys.path.insert(0, '/app/data/mylibs')\nOption 3: Use nbdev Since you’re setting up nbdev, you could develop your library as an nbdev project in /app/data/, which gives you the editable install automatically.\nWhich approach sounds most aligned with your workflow? Are you planning to develop multiple separate libraries, or is this mainly for your journal/notebook utilities?\nJust to be clear, if I decide to install a site-package that is not in the container, I can use the terminal and the package will be installed in /app/data/.local/lib/python3.12/site-packages?\n\n\n🤖Reply🤖\nYes, exactly! When you pip install from the terminal (or notebook with !pip install), packages will go to /app/data/.local/lib/python3.12/site-packages since that’s your user site-packages directory.\nYou can verify this is already happening—remember when you installed uv earlier? It went to /app/data/.local/lib/python3.12/site-packages.\nThe notebook’s Python will automatically find packages there because that directory is in its search path.\nWant to test this with a small package to confirm it works as expected?\nWhat have I learned.\n\nI believe I can run this journal from both environments, while using Solveit as the primary environment.\nI tinkered with sys, platform, sysconfig, jupyter_client, importlib_metadata modules and browsed source code. though can’t say I’m very familiar with any of them.\nI learned that I can poke and prod at this containerized environment and also capture that information for use externally – or trigger for critical updates in my notebooks.\nI like the idea of keeping two envs in sync for my journal project, because there are times when thinking and editing locally is more efficient. For example, my kernel will not die unexpectedly, or my internet access will not pose an issue."
