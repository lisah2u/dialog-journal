    "I'd like to set up an instance of nbdev as a journaling framework in solveit where I can journal about knowledge that I've gained through dialog engineering or via a synthesis of reading, thinking, and coding.

I'd also like to make use of tags both in code cells and documentation. For example, I'd like to be able to tag someone else's dialog that I'd like to re-visit, tag ideas, and tag fragments of knowledge that seem useful. "
