    "Jeremy Howard introduced a course in dialog engineering (\"How to solveit with code\") in 2024 that he has now taught twice. Having recently taken the second run, I've been taken with the methodology of a mixed-initiative, interative conversation between me and an LLM in a notebook-like environment. My early background in computational linguistics was focused dialogue processing... so I'm quite excited about potential intersections here!\n",

While solveit dialogs are notebook-like and convert directly to jupyter notebooks, there are functions and conventions between the two platforms that differ that are not transparent in dialogs themselves.\n",
